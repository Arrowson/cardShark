### Overview:

This is a web application that essentially 'counts' cards for you. The index is <br>
currently blackjack, but I have plans on adding other games as well. Right now, <br>
the plan is to add in:

* Gin Rummy
* Texas Hold'em

---

### Tech

The application is completely written in JQuery (Javascript) and utilizes Bootstrap
for the styling.
